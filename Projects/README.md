# Gesture-Controlled-Robotic-Car

This project titled "Gesture Controlled Robot "  is a robot which can be controlled using gestures of the hand. The project uses OpenCV to count the number of fingers in the image according to which it sends different signals to the arduino based car.
The communication between the laptop and the arduino car is wireless and is done using Bluetooth module HC-05.

## • COMPONENTS

### ARDUINO UNO
The Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by Arduino.cc. The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards (shields) and other circuits. The board has 14 digital I/O pins (six capable of PWM output), 6 analog I/O pins, and is programmable with the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), via a type B USB cable.It can be powered by the USB cable or by an external 9-volt battery, though it accepts voltages between 7 and 20 volts. It is also similar to the Arduino Nano and Leonardo.

### MOTOR  DRIVER
A motor controller is a device or group of devices that serves to govern in some predetermined manner the performance of an electric motor.A motor controller might include a manual or automatic means for starting and stopping the motor, selecting forward or reverse rotation, selecting and regulating the speed, regulating or limiting the torque, and protecting against overloads and electrical faults.
There are many types of starters:
Direct On Line (DOL)
Star delta starter
Auto transformer starter

### BLUETOOTH MODULE
HC‐05 module is an easy to use Bluetooth SPP (Serial Port Protocol) module,designed for transparent wireless serial connection setup.The HC-05 Bluetooth Module can be used in a Master or Slave configuration, making it a great solution for wireless communication.This serial port bluetooth module is fully qualified Bluetooth V2.0+EDR (Enhanced Data Rate) 3Mbps Modulation with complete 2.4GHz radio transceiver and baseband. It uses CSR Bluecore 04‐External single chip Rluetooth system with CMOS technology and with AFH (Adaptive Frequency Hopping Feature)

### MOTOR 
An electric motor is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. Most electric motors operate through the interaction between the motor's magnetic field and electric current in a wire winding to generate force in the form of rotation of a shaft. Electric motors can be powered by direct current (DC) sources, such as from batteries, motor vehicles or rectifiers, or by alternating current (AC) sources, such as a power grid, inverters or electrical generators. 
 
## ●	WORKING MODEL
The device is basically managed and controlled by Arduino Uno microcontroller. The complete setup is based on the application of Open CV environment of Python which helps in processing the image and providing the right information to the users and other specified components. This library helps the computer to process an image or a video which is nothing but a collection of frames.
After processing the image the data is sent to the Arduino which has been coded to instruct the motors after receiving the signal to move in a specific manner. Each signal encodes a specific way of moving the robot in forward , left, right, backward directions respectively.
The data transfer between the Open CV python code and Arduino is achieved through Bluetooth. The buetooth connection is setup in the Arduino by a Bluetooth module HC – 05.


## ●	COST OF THE PROJECT
Due to large scale utilities offered by the robot and its resources offered, the project has costed  around 2500 rupees.
